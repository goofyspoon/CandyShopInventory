# COMS327 Final Project

**What is Final Project?**
*  We have created an inventory system for a candy store owner. This inventory system takes in a flat text file that the candy store owner is currently uses as his own home brew format.
*  The input file follows the format given in the instructions for this project.
*  NOTE: Caramel and Chocolate are automatically given a color of 0. However, it is necessary for correct reading of the input for there to be a value for color for both Caramel and Chocolate as shown in the instructions.

**Why was Final Project made?**
*  This final project was created to showcase my skills I have learned throughout this course (and to help out a candy store owner).
*  This showed knowledge of header files.
*  This showed knowledge on compilation and dependencies.
*  This showed knowledge of makefiles.
*  This showed knowledge of correctly reading input files.
*  This showed knowledge of C++ Classes, subclasses, inheritance, and polymorphism.
*  This showed knowledge of mixing C and C++ files into one working program.

**Who should enjoy Final Project?**
*  Besides the graders for this project, this final project will help out any candy store owner that uses the same input file format as our original candy store owner.

**IMPORTANT: How should Project1 be used?**
*  After unzipping the project folder, simply type make all on a linux prompt to have the makefile create all necessary files. When done, typing make clean will clean up all the unneeded files.
*  The input file follows the format given in the instructions for this project.
*  IMPORTANT NOTE: Caramel and Chocolate are automatically given a color of 0. However, it is necessary for correct reading of the input for there to be a value for color for both Caramel and Chocolate as shown in the instructions.
*  There were issues with printing the name of the candy when using fgets. I believe the issue is resolved by adding tabs (\t) after printing the name; however, it doesn't make for the nicest-looking output.


Enjoy and thanks for a great year of learning!
